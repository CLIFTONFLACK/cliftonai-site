            <h2>1. Research</h2>
            <p>
              For each ingredient, Brian looks first for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, then
              for randomized controlled trials. Priority goes to studies in adults over 40. Brand
              websites, testimonials and social media trends are not used as evidence.
            </p>
            <p>Every claim on a review page carries one of three grades:</p>
            <ul>
              {grades.map((g) => (
                <li key={g}>
                  <strong className="text-fg">{gradeLabels[g].label}:</strong> {gradeLabels[g].meaning}
                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            <p>
              We only describe what a supplement may support in the body. We never say one treats,
              cures or prevents a disease, because no supplement is approved to do that.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Evaluation</h2>
            <p>Each product is then checked against that research:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-fg">Dose.</strong> The amount per serving on the label, set
                against the amount that was actually studied.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-fg">Form.</strong> Whether the product uses the form of the
                ingredient the research used.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-fg">Independent testing.</strong> Third-party certification or
                published lab results where they exist, and a plain note where they do not.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-fg">Cost.</strong> Price per effective serving, not price per
                bottle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-fg">Safety.</strong> Known side effects, medication
                interactions, and who should talk to a doctor first.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-fg">What we do not do yet.</strong> Reviews are desk research
              from published evidence and product labels. No product on this site has been assessed
              by a doctor or tested by patients for this program. If that changes, each review will
              name who took part.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Selection</h2>
            <p>
              Products that pass make the list. The list is short on purpose: one clear answer for
              each need is more useful than twenty options. Every pick is re-checked at least every
              six months, and removed if the evidence, the label or the price stops holding up.
            </p>

            <h2>How Brian earns money</h2>
            <p>
              Some links on these pages pay GetBrian a commission. Commission rates are not part of
              the method, and a brand cannot pay to be listed. Full details are on the{" "}
