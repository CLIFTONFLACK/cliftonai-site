            <p>
              Brian is the voice of GetBrian. The research behind each review is gathered and
              summarized with the help of AI tools, then checked and signed off by Clifton Flack,
              who founded GetBrian. Brian is not a doctor, and nothing here replaces advice from
              yours.

            <h2>Independence</h2>
            <p>
              This is a personal, independent project. It is not connected to any employer, and it
              does not feature products from any company we work for. Brands cannot pay to be
              included. Where we earn a commission, we say so next to the link.
            </p>

            <h2>Corrections</h2>
            <p>
              If you spot an error in a dose, a price or a study, tell us and we will check it and
              update the page.
            </p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>

              medical advice by email.
