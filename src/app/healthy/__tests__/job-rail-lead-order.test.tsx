/**
 * Real `goals` happens to list creatine's uncaveated "strength" before its
 * caveated "focus", so a lead-selection bug that just took `jobGoals[0]`
 * instead of "the first goal without a caveat" would still pick the right
 * one by coincidence and no test against the real data would catch it. This
 * file mocks `../data.ts` (via node:test's --experimental-test-module-mocks,
 * already on in the "test" script, same pattern as why-these-picks/page.test)
 * with the caveated goal listed *first*, so the two selection strategies
 * disagree and the assertion actually exercises the caveat check.
 *
 * JobRail must be imported dynamically, after the mock is installed: this
 * file (deliberately) has no top-level static import of job-rail.tsx, since
 * that would bind it to the real ../data.ts before test.before() runs.
