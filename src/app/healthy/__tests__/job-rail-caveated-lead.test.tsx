 * jobGoals[0] (a caveated goal) once *every* goal of a supplement carries a
 * caveat -- never true in today's data, where strength is creatine's clean
 * lead. This file mocks `../data.ts` (own process, own module cache, same
 * pattern as job-rail-lead-order.test.tsx) to give strength a caveat too, so
 * both of creatine's goals are caveated and the lead-caveat line is reached.
 *
 * JobRail is imported dynamically, after the mock is installed, for the same
 * reason as job-rail-lead-order.test.tsx: a static import would bind it to
 * the real ../data.ts before test.before() runs.
