"""cut/NNN.png -> the three files the site ships, written to out/.

hero-burst.webp        entrance: hop, land, first waves. Plays once.
hero-wave.webp         the wave, looping for ever. Starts where the entrance ends.
hero-burst-still.webp  standing pose, for reduced motion and fallbacks.

Run by hand, from a working folder outside the repo, after cut.py:

    ffmpeg -i clip.mp4 g/%03d.png
    python cut.py        # g/ -> cut/
    python build.py      # cut/ -> out/

then copy out/*.webp into public/healthy/mascot/.

The crop box and the frame ranges below belong to the one clip this was
written for. A new clip needs new numbers: find the union of the figure's
bounds for BOX, the touchdown frame for `air`, and a pair of matching wave
frames for LOOP_A / LOOP_B.

It prints the entrance's running time. ENTRANCE_MS and LANDING_MS in
src/app/healthy/hero-mascot.tsx must be set to what it prints; a test holds
ENTRANCE_MS to the file.
